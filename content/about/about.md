Welcome to DigitalGov :tada:

We provide people in government with the tools, methods, practices and policy guidance needed to create effective digital services and tell their stories of how they are changing the way technology is delivered in the government.

Our job is to know the challenges people in government face, and support them wherever they may be blocked.

We’ve found that agencies need:
Guidance on implementing digital policies and initiatives
Open access to modern methods, practices, policies, and tools
Focused trainings and events that help teams learn and adopt new concepts
Easy access to collaborate with others across government who are working on the same problems
What we are working on
Over the last decade, DigitalGov has become a destination in government to learn about the methods, practices, policies and tools that are needed to create effective digital services.
And we believe DigitalGov should set the example for how government learns, builds, delivers and measures digital services in the 21st century.
We are building DigitalGov into a destination that practices the methods that it teaches, and along the way, we are going to tell the story of how we get there, using the very tools that are available in the open, across the government.
We want to invite you to be part of the next stage of DigitalGov:




We live in a time when [more pre-schoolers can use a smartphone app than can tie their shoes](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/preschoolers-better-at-navigating-iphone-than-tying-their-shoes/). How does government prepare to meet the information needs of these budding citizens? **DigitalGov** means providing information and services to the public anywhere and anytime.

This site is a platform to help those in agencies working on providing digital services and information for the public. We&#8217;ll scour the innerwebs for digital info so you don’t have to. Expect posts on what government is doing in digital, general digital news, trends and issues on implementing digital for the public.

## More on Us

This platform is brought to you by the [Office of Products and Programs](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/124174)—formerly known as the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies (OCSIT)—in the [Technology Transformation Service](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729) (TTS) of the U.S. [General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000). Our job here is to help agencies build a 21st century digital government. We do that by:

  * Finding and sharing resources and capabilities throughout government
  * Helping agencies understand and resolve policy issues
  * Offering services and tools to help agencies meet their digital government goals
  * Championing DigitalGov solutions from loosening data to developing mobile development guidelines to app and website development to best practices and policy
  * Promoting agency DigitalGov efforts
  * Building relationships with the private and non-profit sectors as well as state and local government

### Digital Government Division

The Digital Government Division is a cooperative enterprise that draws on resources from across government to leverage the expertise of forward-leaning agencies. To that end, we’re gathering a cadre of innovators to help build a digital government that meets the expectations of the public while delivering info and services safely and securely.
